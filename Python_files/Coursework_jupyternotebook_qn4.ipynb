    "Question 4 asks whether we are able to detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others. There are 2 perspectives we can implement to answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Observe planes which have consecutive flights**\n",
    "- We can identify whether a plane has departed late from an airport & reached late at its destination. Then, we can check if the plane has departed late from the destination airport to verify if there are cascading failures. \n",
    "- If the departure delay from the destination airport is greater than its arrival delay at the same destination airport, we can also verify that the delays are increasing as the plane travels from one location to other locations consecutively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Observe planes that arrive late & how they affect other planes' departure**\n",
    "- We can identify a flight that has arrived late & take note of the time at which it arrives at the airport. Then, we identify planes that are scheduled to depart from the same airport within a certain timeframe from which the late flight arrived.\n",
    "- We verify if those identified planes also depart late which could be attributed to the plane which reached the airport late. To further verify that the identified planes' late departure is due to the late arrival of the initial flight, we can check whether these late departed flights result in more flights departing late.

    "\n",
    "The **LateAircraftDelay** variable in the ontime table refers to the delays created as a result of the previous flight's late arrival which requires the use of the same plane to depart from that airport. This in turn causes the current scheduled flight to take off late & creates a domino effect, which causes passengers at other airports to board the aircraft much later as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it makes sense to query aircrafts which have \"LateAircraftDelay\" to be able to check if there is indeed cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others. Take note that we query for LateAircraftDelay with the values between 0 & 100 mins as flights with moderate amounts of delay tend not to have their future fligths cancelled which makes analysis easier for us.

Flight N165UW was scheduled to arrive at LaGuardia (LGA) airport at 1724hrs (as indicated by CRSArrTime) but arrived at 1930hrs (as indicated by ArrTime).

However, due to the delay earlier, it departed from LGA airport at 2013hrs & arrived at CLT airport at 2202hrs which resulted in a departure delay of 113 mins & an arrival delay of 99 mins.

Once again, due to the delay earlier, the flight departed at 2250hrs & arrived at 0001hrs. This reuslted in a departure delay of 80 mins & an arrival delay of 72 mins. The flight was once again able to **reduce its arrival delay from 99 mins to 72 mins**. Thus, the delays continue to persist but reduce over time. \n",

It is worth mentioning that whether or not these delays persist depends on how spaced the flights' scheduled trips are as flights which have more \"break\" time between consecutive trips will be able to make up for delays incurred by reducing their break time.
