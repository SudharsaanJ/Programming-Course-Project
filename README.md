# Programming-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to use the flight data for all commercial flights on major airlines within the USA provided by the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo from October 1987 to April 2008 to answer the following questions outlined below:

  1.	When is the best time of day, day of week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
  2.	Do older planes suffer more delays?
  3.	How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
  4.	Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
  5.	Use the available resources to construct a model that predicts delays. 

We will be using programming languages such as R & Python to facilitate analysis of the data provided. SQL would be used within R & Python using libraries such as DBI from R & sqlite3 from Python to query results from databases created.
